== Description

This project is my configuration of the http://ergodox-ez.com[ErgoDox
EZ] keyboard.

At the moment it has the following layers:

[start=0]
. Spanish QWERTY layout, to be used when the Spanish Dvorak is already
  selected in the OS.
. Spanish Dvorak layout, to be used when it's not already selected in
  the OS.
. One-shot function keys.

The thumb keys are arranged after the excellent
https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage2-keyboard/[Kinesis
Advantage], which I've been using for 10 years.

You can see the look of an
https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/QzLDp/latest/0[old
version of this layout, designed with the Oryx online configurator].
I used the
https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/default/latest/0[Oryx
online configurator] to draft and compile the first versions of the
keyboard layout, but it has some limitations, e.g. sticky keys can not
be defined.

== Usage

I compile the source with https://qmk.fm[QMK]. Then I flash the
keyboard with the CLI variant of teensy:

- https://pkgs.org/download/teensy-loader-cli[Debian and Ubuntu
  packages of teensy (CLI variant)]
- https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader_linux.html[binarys of teensy (GUI
  variant)]
